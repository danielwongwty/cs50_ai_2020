# README

This Repository is my implementation of the Projects of a Harvard course, namely "CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python".

This is an Online Course. All the materials are in this [link](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50AI+1T2020).

My code is committed under different branch according to the name of the course project. Feel free to checkout if you're interested in my code. :)
